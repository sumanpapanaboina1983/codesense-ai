Analyze the following feature request and codebase context:

Feature Request: {request}

Architecture Components:
{components}

Files Available: {files_count}

Provide:
1. Scope assessment (which components affected)
2. Integration points identified
3. Similar existing features (if any)
4. Key technical challenges
5. Recommended implementation approach

Be specific and reference actual component names and file paths.

Focus on:
- Understanding the full scope of changes required
- Identifying dependencies that need to be considered
- Recognizing patterns from similar features
- Highlighting potential risks or complexities
